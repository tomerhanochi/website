My name is Tomer Hanochi, and I'm currently employed as a Platform Engineer.
I love diving into new technologies and solving esoteric problems.

This blog is basically my brain dump, where I write down everything I've learned from side projects, experiments, and the occasional late-night coding sessions.

Below you'll see a list of posts that contain a mix of random experiments, deep dives into interesting topics, and a lot of rambling.
